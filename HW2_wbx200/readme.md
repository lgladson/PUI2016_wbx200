# PUI2016_wbx200
#Assignment 1
#For Assignment 1, I followed the instructions provided by Professor Bianco and received a LOT of assistance from Kelsey, Alexey, Chris, Shay, and Matt.  I attended the Tuesday morning session of PUI on 9/20/2016, and received guidance from Alexey, Chris, and Shay afterwards.  Kelsey, Matt, and I kept up via email correspondence.  They were the "teachers" and I was the willing coding student.
#After receiving the MTA API key, I incorporated it as one of two system arguments into the Python Script (the second being the bus line input).  I pulled the data off the URL, loaded it as a JSON file, and sorted through the various dictionaries until I received the latitude/longitude data required.  From here, I incorporated a for-loop with "position" as a function that took me to a general point in the nested dictionaries, followed by the specific addresses that the latitude and longitude coordinates were associated to.
#For Assignment 2, I carried over much of the code from Assignment 1, but expanded on it with the additional stop name and status information in the for loop.  I included "try/except KeyError, leading to N/A" to incorporate the N/A comments in place of blanks for stop name/status data.
