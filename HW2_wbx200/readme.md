#Assignment 1
#For Assignment 1, I generally followed the instructions provided by Professor Bianco for 1) finishing Lab 1 and 2) working on a fork.  I had some questions with Assignment 1 - specifically for fixing the merge - and I asked Sabreen and my group for help, which they provided.  I was able to successfully fork Kelsey's repository and add changes to it - I followed with a merge request which was accepted.  Kelsey returned the favor.
#Assignment 2
#For Assignment 2, I was unfamiliar with the coding required and Google'd things such as how to set up an environmental variable. (Reference: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-read-and-set-environmental-and-shell-variables-on-a-linux-vps)  I was able to set up an environmental variable and an alias - the results are shown in the two screenshots below.

#After this, I again followed the instructions provided to complete the homework assignment.  Thank you.
