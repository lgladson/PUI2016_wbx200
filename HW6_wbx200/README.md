#Assignment 1
For Assignment 1, I worked in a group with Kelsey Reid, Marc Toneatto, Matt Sloane, and Ozgur Akkas.  With help from the greater PUI class (Alexey Kalinin, Shay Lehmann) we were able to set up PUIdata directories and download the data directly there.  For the code, we relied heavily on Yao Wang's homework.  However, we met in a group and pored over the code to understand the concepts behind it and ensured that everyone was on the same page.    

Additional resources: Kelsey found the "pd.to_numeric" code here: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandasdocs/version/0.17.0/generated/pandas.to_numeric.html 

We also utilized this academic document to understand the Chi-square value significance: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj4nvKgseXPAhVTET4KHYA5A2sQFggvMAM&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.runet.edu%2F~biol-web%2Fstats%2Fchi-sq_explanation.doc&usg=AFQjCNH03NP-bgCKFYxa-gko0ezuWeKp_Q&sig2=M476Wb5DOeDv8jHUjecHhQ

Finally, we followed the skeleton notebook as laid out by Professor Bianco.

#Assignment 2

I did not submit HW 3 and relied on my group's Citibike submission, which I uploaded as a notebook.  As a group, we discussed the Authorea write-up and jointly came to a consensus on the report.
