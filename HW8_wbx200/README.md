#Assignment 1
Worked with my group - Kelsey Reid, Matt Sloane, and Marc Toneatto.  We started working on the homework during the class session, based 
off the skeleton notebook provided.
#Assignment 2
Peer reviewed the plots of the two students assigned to me.  Provided comments and feedback and incorporated them into review files -
these were uploaded into my HW8 repo as well as the peers' HW7 repos via Github pull request.
