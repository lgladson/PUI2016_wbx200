#ss4977 Plot Review
Scott’s plot is properly labelled (title, axes, legend, and units) and the color scheme is effective in differentiating the various data points.  Scott also included a caption which both describes the plot and conveys the key takeaway – the Central Limit Theorem and what it means for the data convergence.
<br><br>	The one recommendation that I have is to highlight the skew information a little more so that it stands out from the rest of the plot.  For example, the skew data points, “skew = 0” line, and right y-axis labels and title can all be highlighted in red – thus differentiating it even more from the mean and variance information on the left y-axis.
