#jz2575 Plot Review
Jianghaoâ€™s plot is properly labelled (title, axes, and units) and the distribution of Citibike trip duration is clearly visualized.  The one recommendation I have is to represent time in minutes rather than seconds, as it is a more intuitive measure of ride time and minimizes the magnitude of the data (e.g., 1,500 seconds is much harder to conceptualize than 25 minutes).
Jianghao is missing a figure caption.  There is no summary of the plot and, more importantly, no message being conveyed about the plot itself.  For example, Jianghao can note that most rides do not exceed 25 minutes, which may have ramifications for rates as well as the geographical dispersion of Citibike stations.  Each figure must aid the author in driving the argument he or she is trying to make.
