# Assignment 1
For this week's assignment, I relied heavily on my group's efforts (Members: Kelsey Reid, Matt Sloane, Marc Toneatto, and Ozgur Akkas).  I was
feeling extremely sick this week, and I attribute most of this week's efforts to them.  In addition to following along with their discussion, code,
and email thread, I adhered to the skeleton notebook as laid out by Professor Bianco.  Thanks.
