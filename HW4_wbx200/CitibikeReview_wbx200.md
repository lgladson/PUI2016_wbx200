#The null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly because 1) the hypothesis can be tested mathematically, 2) the null includes the “equal” condition, 3) the alternative is the complement of the null, and 4) the significance level was specified (0.05).  The data supports the project, as each observation (trip) has the variables required (birth year, gender).  The data was properly pre-processed, as the data columns were reduced down to only birth year and gender.
#I would choose T-test to test H_o, because we are interested in intervention and group differences – in this case the difference between men and women (of a certain age) and their propensity for riding Citibikes.  We are also trying to determine the significance of mean group differences.
