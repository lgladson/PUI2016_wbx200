#I was away for travel during Week 4, and thus was limited in my ability to complete this assignment.  I relied greatly on my fellow group members - especially Kelsey Reid, for Assignments #2 and #3.  I honestly was lacking this week, and most of the work should be credited to her.
#For Assignment 1, I met with Siyang in person to discuss the assignment.  I realized that we would not be critiquing each other's assignment, but rather each person was assigned to a different person.  I emailed Professor Bianco to ensure that the person assigned to me would be assigned to someone else, as I had no HW#3 Citibike proposal to review.  Siyang was very helpful and offered her help on this homework assignment.
