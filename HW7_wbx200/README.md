The code for Assignment 1 was taken from Professor Bianco's solution to Homework 5, Assignment 2.  I incorporated minor edits to the code in order to adhere to the recommendations laid out in Lecture 7 regarding data visualization.  Please see below for the figure:

<br><br>Figure 1. This is a comparison of female to male median income, based on the 2014 Annual Social and Economic Supplement from the U.S. Census Bureau. The data points represent the female-male income pair for each demographic (All, Asian, Black, Hispanic, White). The dotted line represents the "Income Equality Line," at which females and males earn the same income. Based off of this line, we can see that female income is significantly below male income across the demographic spectrum.
